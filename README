To build:
- need autotools with autconf version 2.59 (at least)
- tools include autoconf, automake, m4, and libtool
- standard OS installations of these should work

To start from base directory:
- ./autogen

To configure threaded version:
- ./configure --enable-threads

To configure mpi version:
- ./configure

Other options:
- ./configure --help

To compile
- make clean
- make all

To install/uninstall
- make install
- make uninstall

config files located in etc/ -- require a new ./configure if changes are made locally
- add the mpirun path for mpi (it may work as is, but I recommend the full path)
- can modify the number of procs/threads for each program
- can allow n-to-1 writes for the the destination

To run:
- ./scripts/pfls (or pfcm, pfcp)
